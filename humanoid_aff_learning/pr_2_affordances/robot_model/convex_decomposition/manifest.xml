<description brief="Convex Mesh Generation Library">

<p>
<tt>convex_decomposition</tt> contains the Convex Mesh Generation Library, by John Ratcliff.  This library is used to auto-generate convex decomposed meshes for
collision and visualization of robot links.  
</p>
<p>
We are using the latest and the only version available.  We plan on deprecating this package
once we find a better alternative.  
</p>
<p>
The Convex Mesh Generation Library is not provided by
any of the major OS package managers, and this version provided
here contains patches required for compilation.
These patches have not been submitted back as there
appears to be no available revision control.
